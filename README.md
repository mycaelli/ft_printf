This projects aims to replicate the C function <b>printf</b> from stdio.h lib.
In this implementation we have the flags for printing: 
<ul> 
<li>char (*%c*) </li>
<li> strings (*%s*) </li>
<li>decimal numbers (*%d* and *%i*) </li>
<li>hexadeciaml numbers (*%x* and *%X*) </li>
<li>address (*%p*) </li>
</ul>
To develop this i had to understand how to use variadic functions and how to link different Makefiles together 
<br />
<br />
Studies file contaims links that helped me understand and develop the project
Makefile_test contaims targets that runs the project with a main function
