This projects aims to replicate the C function **printf** from stdio.h lib
In this implementation we have the flags for printing:
- char (*%c*)
- strings (*%s*)
- decimal numbers (*%d* and *%i*)
- hexadeciaml numbers (*%x* and *%X*)
- address (*%p*)
To develop this i had to understand how to use variadic functions and how to link different Makefiles together
#
#
Studies file contaims links that helped me understand and develop the project
Makefile_test contaims targets that runs the project with a main function
